# movie_recommendations
A movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and machine learning techniques in Python.
Run through the Main.ipynb file first, it creates a required file (similarity.pkl) which could not be uploaded here because of being too large (800mb).
Then you can run the app.py file using 'streamlit run app.py' command on your terminal which opens up the movie recommendation interface on your local host.
